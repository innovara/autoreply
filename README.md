# autoreply.py

## Introduction

`autoreply.py` is a Postfix filter to send auto-reply emails when a message sent to a qualifying email address enters the Postfix mail system.

It supports authentication, StartTLS and HTML for the auto-reply.

The proposed Postfix configuration uses `check_recipient_access` to instruct Postfix to only pipe emails that are addressed to these qualifying email addresses to `autoreply.py`, while the rest continue their normal flow. The script, using settings stored in `autoreply.json`, sends the auto-reply and re-injects the original email into Postfix for delivery.

The look up table related to `check_recipient_access` is used for any mail received by SMTP but not for emails sent locally, using sendmail.

`autoreply.py` could be easily adapted to do other things with the original email like extracting information or storing attachments.

The following sections provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up `autoreply.py` and Postfix to send auto-replies.

## Background

One of our clients had a complex email infrastructure and they wanted a script that would trigger auto-replies when emails sent to some specific addresses entered one of their MTAs. Normally, these auto-replies would have been configured at an MDA/mailbox level.

The MTA in question was Postfix and it relayed all the emails to another SMTP server which they couldn't/wanted to configure differently.

After some consideration, it was deemed viable to use an after-queue content filter in Postfix to achieve this.

As the email addresses that would need to auto-reply would change over time, as well as the subjects and wording of the auto-reply emails, we decided to use a JSON file to store that information which could be changed without having to edit the script.

## System configuration

This section is somehow optional but please note that, as per [Postfix's FILTER documentation](http://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html), filter scripts should be run using a separate account, as these are handling potentially malicious emails. To quote their documentation, do not use "nobody", and most certainly do not use "root" or "postfix".

1. Add autoreply user with home directory /opt/autoreply and nologin.
```shell
sudo useradd -d /opt/autoreply -s /usr/sbin/nologin autoreply
```
2. Create autoreply's home directory.
```shell
sudo mkdir /opt/autoreply
```
3. Change autoreply's home directory ownership.
```shell
sudo chown autoreply:autoreply /opt/autoreply
```
4. Restrict access to autoreply's home directory.
```shell
sudo chmod 700 /opt/autoreply
```
## Script configuration

1. Change to autoreply user.
```
sudo su - autoreply -s /bin/bash
```
2. Download `autoreply.py`.
```shell
wget https://github.com/innovara/autoreply/raw/master/autoreply.py
```
3. Change permissions.
```shell
chmod 700 autoreply.py
```
3. Run ./autoreply.py -j to generate ~/autoreply.json.
```
./autoreply.py -j
```
4. Edit autoreply.json.
```
nano autoreply.json
```
```json
{
    "logging": false,
    "SMTP": "localhost",
    "port": 25,
    "starttls": false,
    "ssl": false,
    "smtpauth": false,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "autoreply": [
        {
            "email": "foo@bar",
            "from": "Foo Bar <foo@bar>",
            "reply-to": "foo@bar",
            "subject": "RE: {ORIGINAL_SUBJECT}",
            "body": "Email body here, autoreply for {ORIGINAL_DESTINATION}",
            "html": false,
            "_comment": "If you set html to true, set body to the full path of your html file"
        }
    ]
}
```
Explanation:
* logging: true or false to enable/disable logging to ~/autoreply.log.
* SMTP: server that will send the auto-reply emails.
* port: SMTP port of the server.
* starttls: true to enable STARTTLS.
* ssl: true to enable SSL when it is required from the beginning of the connection and using STARTTLS is not appropriate.
* smtpauth: true if authentication is required.
* username: SMTP user.
* password: SMTP user's password.
* email: email address, or list of email addresses, that would trigger an auto-reply.
* from: email address that you want to show the auto-reply coming from.
* reply-to: the reply-to email address the auto-reply receivers will see. Useful when using noreply@...
* subject: the subject of the auto-reply email. Use {ORIGINAL_SUBJECT} to include the original subject from the sender.
* body: text of auto-reply email when using plain-text format, or path to HTML file when using it. Use {ORIGINAL_DESTINATION}, here or on the HTML file, to include the email address of the recipient that triggered the autoreply.
* html: true when using HTML auto-reply emails.

Note about upgrades and the configuration file:

`auto-reply.py` doesn't implement any version control nor is developed with much attention to issues arising from the script encountering previous versions of the configuration file. Therefore, the script can crash when a new setting is not present because of this. The recommendation when upgrading is to create a new JSON config file and to port the existing settings to it. And of course, it is expected that you will test this on a pre-production environment to ensure new changes won't break anything for you in production. If copying existing settings isn't a viable solution because of the size of your deployment, considering reaching out to us for a commercial engagement to further develop upgrade paths.

5. If you want to set up a few email addresses that share the same auto-reply configuration, the JSON file would look something like this.

```json
{
    "logging": false,
    "SMTP": "localhost",
    "port": 25,
    "starttls": false,
    "ssl": false,
    "smtpauth": false,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "autoreply": [
        {
            "email": "foo1@bar, foo2@bar",
            "from": "Foo Bar <foo@bar>",
            "reply-to": "foo@bar",
            "subject": "RE: {ORIGINAL_SUBJECT}",
            "body": "/path/to/email.html",
            "html": true,
            "_comment": "If you set html to true, set body to the full path of your html file"
        }
    ]
}
```

6. If you want to set up various email addresses with different auto-reply configuration, the JSON file would look something like this.
```json
{
    "logging": false,
    "SMTP": "localhost",
    "port": 25,
    "starttls": false,
    "ssl": false,
    "smtpauth": false,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "autoreply": [
        {
            "email": "foo1@bar",
            "from": "Foo1 Bar <foo1@bar>",
            "reply-to": "foo1@bar",
            "subject": "RE: {ORIGINAL_SUBJECT}",
            "body": "/path/to/email.html",
            "html": true,
            "_comment": "If you set html to true, set body to the full path of your html file"
        },
        {
            "email": "foo2@bar",
            "from": "Foo2 Bar <foo2@bar>",
            "reply-to": "foo2@bar",
            "subject": "RE: {ORIGINAL_SUBJECT}",
            "body": "Email body here, autoreply for {ORIGINAL_DESTINATION}",
            "html": false,
            "_comment": "If you set html to true, set body to the full path of your html file"
        }
    ]
}
```

7. If you want to create an email file for testing, use `./autoreply.py -t` and edit `test.txt` to change `From`, `To` and `Reply-to` accordingly.
```shell
./autoreply.py -t
nano test.txt
```
8. Run a test from the command line.
```
./autoreply.py from@bar to@bar < test.txt
```

At this point, the recipient of the test email should have received the test email from the sender, and the sender an auto-reply message from the recipient.

9. Exit autoreply shell
```
exit
```

## Postfix configuration

Now, you have to edit the configuration of the Postfix server to pipe emails to the script.

You could pipe all the emails to `autoreply.py`, but the script would unnecessarily handle a number of emails that would not trigger an auto-reply. 
To avoid emails out of the scope of `autoreply.py` being piped to it, we use `check_recipient_access` under `smtpd_recipient_restrictions` in `main.cf`.

Bear in mind that, if there are multiple recipients, Postfix will pipe the email as long as at least one of them is in the lookup table. 

1. Create a Postfix lookup table input file.
```shell
sudo nano /etc/postfix/autoreply
```
2. Add one line per recipient:
```
foo@bar FILTER autoreply:dummy
```
3. Create its corresponding Postfix lookup table.
```shell
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/autoreply
```
4. Back up `main.cf`.
```shell
sudo cp /etc/postfix/main.{cf,cf.bak}
```
5. Edit `main.cf`.
```shell
sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
```
6. Add the new lookup table as the first item in `smtpd_recipient_restrictions`.
```
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/autoreply
```
7. Back up `master.cf`.
```
sudo cp /etc/postfix/master.{cf,cf.bak}
```
8. Edit `master.cf`.
```shell
sudo nano /etc/postfix/master.cf
```
9. Add the autoreply pipe at the end of the file. Edit user and script path if you are not following the instructions regarding system configuration. 
```
# autoreply pipe
autoreply unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags= user=autoreply null_sender=
  argv=/opt/autoreply/autoreply.py ${sender} ${recipient}
```
10. Restart Postfix.
```shell
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```
You are ready to go. If everything went well, when Postfix receives emails that are addressed to your target auto-reply recipients, it will pass them to `autoreply.py` and the script will send the auto-reply email according to your configuration.
